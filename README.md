# concourse-terraform-plan-reporter

A Concourse resource to generate a report from a speculative terraform plan.

Written in Python, it currently supports publishing the report of changes as a table to a Github Pull Request
by taking advantage of the [telia-oss/github-pr-resource](https://github.com/telia-oss/github-pr-resource)
to fetch metadata for the PR.

## Source Configuration

| Parameter | Required | Default | Description |
|-|-|-|-|
| gh_api_endpoint | No | `https://api.github.com` | The API endpoint for the Github instance to which the resource should publish the speculative plan report. |
| gh_access_token | Yes |  | The Github Personal Access Token to be used for accessing the Github API endpoint. This is usually fetched from a secret store like Vault and defined in the pipeline configuration as ((github.access_token)) |
| gh_repository | Yes | | The Github repository for which the pipeline is being executed. The path should be in the format `org_name/repo_name`. |
| pr_path | Yes | | The directory path to the pull request where `get` on `github-pr-resource` fetches the repository and the pull request metadata. |

## Behavior

### `check`

N/A. The check itself doesn't do anything in this resource currently to trigger
any action.

### `put`

| Parameter | Required | Default | Description |
|-|-|-|-|
| plan_json_file | Yes | | The path to the terraform plan in the JSON format, generated using `terraform show --json <plan_file>`. This can be the result of a task or the use of `ljfranklin/terraform-resource` |

The version emitted from out is a `base64` representation of the comment posted to Github Pull Request.
in the markdown table format, comprising of the resources that are being created, modified or removed and an expandable description of
the attributes that are changed for each resource.

### `get`

The base64 representation of the comment URL is decoded and written to a file called `state_changes.md`
under the resource directory.
